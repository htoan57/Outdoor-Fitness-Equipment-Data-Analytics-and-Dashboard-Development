# Outdoor Fitness Equipment Data Analytics and Dashboard Development

## Overview
This project, led by **UniSA STEM**, is focused on transforming how councils and community health stakeholders understand the usage of outdoor fitness equipment in public parks. By leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the initiative collects data on equipment utilisation and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity).

The objective is to convert raw sensor data into actionable insights that support evidence-based decision-making. With these insights, local governments can improve park design, promote physical activity, and optimise community infrastructure to enhance public health outcomes.

## Project Context
Outdoor fitness equipment has become an important feature of public spaces, encouraging participation across diverse communities. Yet planning decisions are often made with limited quantitative evidence on how, when, and where equipment is used.

This project addresses that gap. It brings together equipment usage signals and environmental context to reveal patterns of engagement, helping stakeholders prioritise investment, maintenance, and design improvements that maximise community benefit.

## Objectives and Outcomes
The project is designed to deliver practical value for decision-makers alongside robust technical foundations.

### Key Outcomes
1. **Data Processing Pipelines**  
   Documented methods for cleaning and preprocessing IoT data covering equipment usage and environmental conditions.

2. **Interactive Dashboard**  
   - Time-series visualisations of equipment usage  
   - Heatmaps of activity across parks and equipment categories  
   - Correlations between environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) and equipment use  
   - Comparative insights across sites and equipment types  
   - Data download capability for further analysis

3. **Code Repository**  
   A well-structured, well-documented codebase to support transparency, reproducibility, and future continuation.

## Technology and Approach
The delivery approach combines **data engineering**, **exploratory analytics**, and **dashboard visualisation**:
- Cleaning and transforming raw IoT sensor outputs into analysis-ready datasets  
- Profiling and exploring usage patterns across sites and environmental conditions  
- Designing and building an interactive Power BI dashboard tailored to stakeholder questions
